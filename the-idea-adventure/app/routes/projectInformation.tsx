                        This game has a restiriction. This Games characters goes to sleep at 19pm. why? becuse this small webbgame is targetet towards kids. Is it a bad idea to restrict a game from players? propobly. But i wish to start an open conversation on how we can better protect children and minors online.

                    <p>However a conversation needs to start somewere, so I will start. What if: Games made with minors in mind are not just online, with chatrooms and cloud storage. what if we bring back the good old cd, like the old retro pc games.
                        What about what i did in this game, that may be targeted for the younger kids? Well i do belive restiricting a game if at the choice of the developer, and that it may not be a great idea but it did bring you here to read this and in the end, that was the point.
